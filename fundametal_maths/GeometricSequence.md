# Geometric sequence

Similar to arithmetic sequence, a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the ratio between the consecutive terms is constant. For example,

- 1 2 4 8 16 is a geometric sequence because the ratio between consecutive numbers is 2. (for example, 2/1 = 2, 4/2 = 2, 8/4 = 2, 16/8 = 2).
- 1 3 9 27 81 is a geometric sequence because the ratio between consecutive numbers is 3. (for example, 3/1 = 3, 9/3 = 3, 27/9 = 3, 81/27 = 3).
- 1 2 6 is NOT a geometric sequence because 2 / 1 = 2 but 6 / 2 = 3. Here, the ratio between consecutive elements is different.

The sum of a geometric sequence is ```first_element * (1 - ratio ^ number_of_elements) / ( 1 - ratio )```.

Geometric sequence is useful in **counting the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree**.
